This repository demonstrates a common TypeScript type error: Type 'string[]' is not assignable to type 'string'. The `bug.ts` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.ts` provides a corrected version. The error arises when a function expecting a string argument is provided with an array of strings. The solution shows how to handle this by either modifying the function signature or appropriately processing the input array before passing it to the function.
